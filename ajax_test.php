/**
 * ajax_test.php along with ajax_test.htm demonstrates simple event based AJAX 
 * via AJAX
 * 
 * AJAX call goes to php page 'dynamic_lists_AJAX.php' which uses a car 'object' to store
 * make model and year data of a selection of cars.
 *
 * When the user selects a make and year from a form, AJAX is used to retrieve an XML snippet 
 * and the code uses JavaScript on the DOM to update a select object with an id of 'modelSelect'.
 *
 * Adapted from demo by Ryan Asleson, 'Foundations Of Ajax', originally written for Java. 
 * Rewritten in PHP by Bill
